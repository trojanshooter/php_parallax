Adam and Ariana had been seeing each other for many years now and they were expecting their first baby boy in a few months. They decided to get married at the beautiful and elegant <a href='http://sfcityhallevents.org/' target='_blank'>City Hall, San Francisco</a> in a few weeks. They had long been husband and wife in their hearts but saying &quot;We Do&quot; at this beautiful wedding venue made it all the very special.</p>"

Today it is a popular venue for weddings and events. The venue features views of San Francisco Bay, the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, and the Presidio forest – a remarkable vantage point from every room. The graceful Spanish Colonial Revival-building offers a spectacular setting for a special wedding celebration.</p><p>The Golden Gate Club was the perfect venue for Alex and Sarah's wedding. It totally complimented the bride and grooms personality - beautiful, elegant and classy. The flowers, lighting, decoration and the views made for a perfect day of wedding along with all the celebrations and frolic. Before the wedding, we coordinated for the first look at the beautiful hallway that was so royal. The bride was a Cubs fan and the icing on the cake was for the Cubs to win the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_World_Series' target='_blank'>World Series</a> that year. She made sure to have a special pin attached to her bouquet to preserve the memory - sign of a true fan! A lot of detail in the wedding - specially the table decorations, flowers and the guest seating labels. They arranged for the <a href='https://www.sfmta.com/getting-around/muni/cable-cars' target='_blank'>Cable Car</a> bus to get some pictures atop of this national historic landmark. At the end of the night when it was all over, a friend of the bride and groom dressed up as Clark, the Cubs mascot and made a special entry that added so much fun to the evening.</p>"

It was a beautiful day to have an outdoor wedding - the sun shining bright and at the same time a fog cover that adorned the mountains in the background. The clouds provided a perfect backdrop for the bride and groom to say their vows without the need for a wedding altar. Hannah got ready at the venue. It was a fun wedding to say the least - where Andrew would never stop cracking jokes and which made Hannah swell up with laughter. Hannah did get emotional though walking back on the aisle with Andrew after they got married which was so touching. It was a great pleasure to be a part of the wedding and witness the love between two beautiful people.</p>"

An ideal location and fun environment was full of refined elegance and rustic charm – the perfect setting for a stunning beachfront ceremony with wide ocean views, lush forests, and golden meadows reflected beautifully in the natural color palette of greens, greys, and hints of gold. There was kite flying, music, dancing and BBQ that made the day even more fun. It was truly an honor capturing their wonderful day.</p>"

This cute little lady brought in so much fun and lighter moments during the wedding photoshoot. After the wedding and the been pictures taken in the City Hall, Taylor and Jackie decided to do their first dance in the open grounds outside the City Hall. This was the most amazing thing I had ever seen. With the beautiful and elegant City Hall in the background and a bride &amp; groom dancing in the foreground - just made it a very romantic scene that I loved capturing. I always love capturing City Hall weddings but this one was truly special.</p>"
