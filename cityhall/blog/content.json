		"text": "<p>Taylor and Jackie decided to tie their knot at the City Hall in San Francisco in the later part of the year in 2017. Such a wonderful couple to work with. Always carried a pleasant smile and so photogenic - it was a pleasure capturing their blissful wedding. Jackie's daughter Brooklyn was the flower girl at the wedding. This cute little lady brought in so much fun and lighter moments during the wedding photoshoot. After the wedding and the been pictures taken in the City Hall, Taylor and Jackie decided to do their first dance in the open grounds outside the City Hall. This was the most amazing thing I had ever seen. With the beautiful and elegant City Hall in the background and a bride &amp; groom dancing in the foreground - just made it a very romantic scene that I loved capturing. I always love capturing City Hall weddings but this one was truly special.</p>"
